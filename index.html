            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>For multinational companies, the management of <strong>business integrity risk</strong> is a complex,
               rapidly-evolving and increasingly multifaceted exercise. New types of integrity risks recently have
               emerged, especially in relation to <strong>human rights</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>These risks can have reputational, financial and political consequences—but they are also increasingly
               legal in nature. An emerging web of human rights regulations, mandatory disclosure requirements,
               soft law instruments (most notably, the <strong>UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
               Rights</strong> (the “<strong>UNGPs</strong>”)) and industry standards exposes businesses to potential government
               sanctions, lawsuits under domestic tort and securities laws, contract claims and investor pressure. 
            </p>
            <p>A systemic approach to integrity risk can help prevent potential adverse human rights impacts,
               demonstrate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, mitigate litigation risk and
               help meet stakeholder expectations. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Debevoise Integrity Screen</strong> provides in-house counsel, sustainability leaders and compliance
               departments with a tool aimed at navigating this increasingly complex area and its many legal
               dimensions. The Screen includes a series of questions and practice points designed to guide business
               enterprises in addressing the UNGP’s three pillars for demonstrating “respect” for human rights. Such
               organizations should have in place:
            </p>
            <p><img src="./images/notes.svg"/> <a  title="Hello" style="cursor: pointer; color: #f0144c;">policy</a> commitment to meet their responsibility;</p>
            <p><img src="./images/view.svg"/> <a  title="Hello" style="cursor: pointer; color: #f0144c;">A due diligence process</a>  to identify, prevent and mitigate potential adverse human rights
               impacts; and
            </p>
            <p><img src="./images/guide.svg"/> A <a  title="Hello" style="cursor: pointer; color: #f0144c;">process to enable remediation</a> of such impacts they cause or to which they contribute.</p>
            <p>Each company ultimately will require a bespoke, context-specific and commercially-reasonable
               solution to mitigate the particular integrity risks that it faces. A comprehensive and integrated  
               approach to business risk may be the most efficient and effective option. This includes possibly
               capitalizing on existing compliance systems, such as leveraging and supplementing established
               anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering policies and procedures to cover emerging human
               rights risks.
            </p>
            <p>It is likewise imperative that related policies, processes and public statements do not inadvertently
               create litigation risk. When tending to these risk areas, it is important to consult appropriately
               with in­house lawyers and external counsel, including in developing policies, drafting
               disclosure materials, conducting due diligence and designing remediation programs. In doing so,
               companies should make sure to take proper steps to safeguard the attorney-client privilege and the
               related protections that properly shield certain materials from external disclosure.
            </p>
